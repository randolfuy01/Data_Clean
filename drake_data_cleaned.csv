new girl late june or early july i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied now it s december  i m driving  and she s like  where s my hi   it s weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy see that was a segue  i believe the matter is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter where the timb  laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up where girls become exes from summer s caught ho in the winter cars come out  the summer cars go in and some places is breezy  and some it start snowin  and if you planning family vacations you better know when but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late  she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties    drake talking  yeah man  it s a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls y know  wanna get close  you might think they the one but just wait  nah mean  take it slow   verse 2  drake  forget to mention  this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street  and so we destined to meet since i m driving  i ask her how to get to the suite she doesn t answer  opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back  and starts adjusting the heat she s bold but i roll with it  i m impressed cause she s sweet then she says  i heard your song and i m obsessed with the beat i mean  the lyrics are good  but i m obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good there s a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat  off this i m kinda taken back for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do  and it s kind of awkward  the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin  and now my heart attached i m thinkin off i should ve been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin  and ho    drake talking  yeah  uh  i told ya ll i had a story for you right uh  ya man  it s what it is   verse 3  drake  and now  i m proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench but  my boy say i m actin different  because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone i mma hold here down tell everyone i m the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon  last me the whole year round but then spring shows up  and it s dallas in this bitch the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana  and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage  she saving for caribana and it s a shame  she had me convinced that she could ve been a dime i guess  i lost another one to the wintertime   bridge  drake talking   i miss you  most of all  my darling  beat fades out   give me a second to gather my thoughts   fades back in  strolling in the park  ho   and watching winter turn to spring  such a beautiful day man   yeah man  you know we had to switch it on  em right   strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing  i m still standing on two feet  even after this tragic loss   man  but i got something to else to tell ya baby    verse 4  drake  i remember them encore pms  breakfast and the wake up now drake s committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that won t act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her by the end of the week i would know that crew and we d assembled a trio  a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin  we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different it s a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handlin  crack is a one man sport instead of dress up  i walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin  i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin  the face  the breast  the bras  the toes i m still solo and a long night draws to a close cause it s a fact  if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside we ll never talk again  scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well it s like a classified it s what i m lookin for to carry me through yet i can t seem to find it  every girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit and when they talk about they past and lovers and you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself  now least there s some room to ride there s also room for improvement as soon as june arrive   voice  strolling in the park  and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park  and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park  and watching winter turn to spring

254,Try Harder Lyrics, verse 1  drake  sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough to feel what i m about to say in this song when they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself and you do it and get the feeling it s wrong that there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping and they try to make you out as a lie it s ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason it s a lose lose why even try when your ideas so frequently get rejected people just get neglected and they never really know how to feel phone calls is something that you re expecting for someone without the ethics and the motives to try and make them a mill you never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and they just wanna say that you ain t around i mean there s always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming that you couldn t help and maybe next time you ain t in town  chorus   x4  you gonna try to try harder cuz try harder cuz try try try try   verse 2  drake  and the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin  is fresher than most of these rappers running the game certain people will copy what s in the past to turn the profit with cash there s time i would have done it the same i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience that made you tell anybody i meet that i rent sometimes i wish that i would just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers because i m really tend to need what i spent in a house that i promised to get my mother don t compensate for the other time i wasted out late at the club instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner i m working hard on the winter so this album is a labor of love you say as long as i m staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats that she can rest without a toss and a turn because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on tv that s exactly why i often get burned but i m gonna try to    chorus   x4
